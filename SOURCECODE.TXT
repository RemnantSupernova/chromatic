Take note:

You need MASM32 and Visual C++ (6 or a more recent version but you'll have to convert the project
and i don't guarantee the result).

BuildRC.bat need to be used if any resource is modified.
ChromaticSupp.dll can be asembled within Chromatic itself (via MASM32).

You may need some extra system headers but i don't remember which ones (maybe dbghelp.h & dbghelp.lib).

Innosetup is to be used with the provided InstallScript.iss file.

The release directory contains stock clean .ini files used during the creation of the installation package.
